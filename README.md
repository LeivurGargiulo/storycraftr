# StoryCraftr - Your AI-powered Book Creation Assistant üìöü§ñ

Welcome to **StoryCraftr**, the open-source project designed to revolutionize how books are written. With the power of AI and a streamlined command-line interface (CLI), StoryCraftr helps you craft your story, manage worldbuilding, structure your book, and generate chapters ‚Äî all while keeping you in full control.

If you're passionate about writing, coding, or both, we invite you to collaborate with us on making StoryCraftr the ultimate AI writing assistant! üöÄ

## Why StoryCraftr?

Writing a book is a journey that involves not only creativity but also structure, consistency, and planning. **StoryCraftr** is here to assist you with:
- **Worldbuilding**: Define the geography, history, cultures, and more.
- **Outline**: Generate a cohesive story outline, from character summaries to chapter synopses.
- **Chapters**: Automatically generate chapters, cover pages, and epilogues based on your ideas.

With StoryCraftr, you'll never feel stuck again. Let AI guide your creative process, generate ideas, and help you bring your world and characters to life.

## Key Features

- **AI-powered writing assistant**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT models to help you write everything from chapter summaries to detailed plot points.
- **Modular structure**: Each aspect of the book (outline, worldbuilding, chapters) is handled individually, allowing full customization.
- **Markdown-based**: All generated content is saved in Markdown, making it easy to integrate with any writing workflow.
- **Customizable prompts**: You control the prompts and direction the AI takes.
